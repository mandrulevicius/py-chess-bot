### Installation

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/mandrulevicius/py-chess-bot.git
   cd py-chess-bot
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Install Stockfish** (if not already installed)
   - Download from [stockfishchess.org](https://stockfishchess.org/)

### Run the Game

```bash
python main.py
```

**Command line options:**
```bash
python main.py --difficulty 15 --color black
```

- `--difficulty` / `-d`: AI difficulty level (0-20, default: 8)

## üéÆ How to Play

### Starting the Game
```
==================================================
      Welcome to PyChessBot!
      Human vs AI Chess Game
==================================================

Instructions:
- Enter moves in standard algebraic notation (e.g., e4, Nf3, O-O)
- Type 'help' for available commands
- Type 'quit' to exit the game
```

### Chess Notation Examples
- `e4` - Pawn to e4
- `Nf3` - Knight to f3  
- `Bxc5` - Bishop captures on c5
- `O-O` - Kingside castling
- `O-O-O` - Queenside castling
- `e8=Q` - Pawn promotion to Queen
- `Qh5+` - Queen to h5 with check
- `Nf7#` - Knight to f7, checkmate

### In-Game Commands
- `help` - Show help and notation examples
- `history` - Display move history
- `legal` - Show all legal moves
- `status` - Show current game status
- `clear` - Clear screen
- `quit` - Exit game

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture

The project follows clean architecture principles with clear separation of concerns:

```
src/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ game/           # Core chess logic
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ move_parser.py      # SAN notation parsing
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ move_validator.py   # Move validation with position awareness
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ board_state.py      # Immutable board state management
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ game_loop.py        # Game flow and turn management
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ ai/             # AI integration
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ stockfish_ai.py     # Stockfish engine wrapper
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ ui/             # User interface
    ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ console_interface.py # Console I/O and display
```

### Key Design Principles

- **Immutable State** - All game operations return new state objects
- **Functional Programming** - Preferred over classes where appropriate
- **Validation Layers** - Educational parser + position-aware validation
- **Problem Domain Separation** - Clear boundaries between game/AI/UI
- **Test-Driven Development** - RED-GREEN-REFACTOR cycles throughout

## üß™ Testing

Run the comprehensive test suite:

```bash
# All tests
python -m pytest tests/ -v

# Specific component
python -m pytest tests/game/ -v          # Game engine tests
python -m pytest tests/ai/ -v            # AI integration tests  
python -m pytest tests/ui/ -v            # Interface tests

# With coverage
python -m pytest tests/ --cov=src
```

**Test Coverage:**
- 58 total tests across all components
- Move parsing and validation (13 tests)
- Board state management (7 tests)
- Game loop functionality (7 tests)
- Stockfish AI integration (8 tests)
- Console interface (12 tests)
- Main application (10 tests)

## üîß Development

### Project Setup
```bash
# Install development dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Run linting
black .
flake8 .

# Run type checking
mypy .
```

### TDD Workflow

This project follows strict Test-Driven Development:

1. **RED**: Write failing test for new feature
2. **GREEN**: Write minimal code to pass test  
3. **REFACTOR**: Clean up while keeping tests green
4. **COMMIT**: Commit working implementation

See [`CLAUDE.md`](CLAUDE.md) for detailed development guidelines and [`docs/`](docs/) for design documents.

  - `python-chess>=1.999` - Chess logic and validation
  - `stockfish>=3.28.0` - AI engine wrapper
  - `pygame>=2.1.0` - GUI framework (future use)
  - `pytest>=7.0.0` - Testing framework

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### "Stockfish not found" Error
- Ensure Stockfish is installed and in PATH
- Or place binary in `c:/programs/stockfish/` (Windows)
- Check binary name matches your system (e.g., `stockfish-windows-x86-64-avx2.exe`)

### Import Errors
- Verify Python 3.7+ is installed
- Run `pip install -r requirements.txt`
- Check virtual environment activation

### Performance Issues
- Lower AI difficulty level (`--difficulty 5`)
- Ensure Stockfish binary matches your CPU architecture
