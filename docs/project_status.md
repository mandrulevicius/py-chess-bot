ok# PyChessBot - Project Status

## Current Phase
**Pre-implementation planning** - Ready to begin TDD development

## Architecture Decisions Made
- ✅ **Notation**: Standard Algebraic Notation (SAN) - e4, Nf3, O-O
- ✅ **Rule Engine**: python-chess library for validation
- ✅ **AI Engine**: Stockfish with Python wrapper (configurable difficulty 0-20)
- ✅ **UI Strategy**: PyGame for main interface + Console for dev/debug
- ✅ **Development Methodology**: Test Driven Development (TDD)
- ✅ **Code Style**: Prefer procedural over class-based when appropriate

## Implementation Approach
- **Red-Green-Refactor**: Make it work, make it right, make it fast
- **Make the change easy, then make the easy change**
- **Write tests first** (where they make sense), then implement

## Dependencies Installed
- ✅ `python-chess` (1.999) - Chess logic and validation
- ✅ `stockfish` (3.28.0) - AI engine wrapper  
- ✅ `pygame` (2.6.1) - GUI framework

## Repository Setup
- ✅ Git repository initialized
- ✅ .gitignore configured (Python + Claude Code)
- ✅ Initial documentation committed
- ✅ Development methodology documented in CLAUDE.md

## New Decisions Made
- ✅ **File organization**: Problem domain structure
- ✅ **Testing framework**: pytest (familiar and feature-rich)
- ✅ **Stockfish location**: c:/programs/stockfish (also in PATH)
- ✅ **Feature priority**: Start with move parsing and validation
- ✅ **Test structure**: Mirror source structure in tests/

## New Decisions Made (Continued)
- ✅ **python-chess integration**: Option 2 - Validation Layer (keep our parser + add position validation)
- ✅ **Board state tracking**: Needed for chess game functionality
- ✅ **Code structure approach**: Lean toward procedural when it makes sense and doesn't complicate decisions, otherwise use what feels most comfortable per situation

## Outstanding Decisions
- **UI layout**: Specific PyGame interface design  
- **Error handling**: Approach for invalid moves and game state errors

## Next Steps
1. **Choose first feature** to implement with TDD
2. **Set up basic project structure** (src/, tests/ directories)
3. **Write first test** for chosen feature
4. **Implement minimal code** to pass test
5. **Commit and iterate**

## Project Goals Recap
- Human vs AI chess game for educational purposes
- Standard notation support with clear error feedback
- Simple but competent AI opponent
- Clean, maintainable codebase following TDD principles
