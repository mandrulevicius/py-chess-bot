# PyChessBot - Current State

## Currently Working On
- **One-Shot Quality Enhancement Session** - Comprehensive code quality improvements and alternative implementations

## Current Task Progress
- **In Progress**: Creating documentation files for quality enhancement tasks
- **Planned**: Structured logging system implementation
- **Planned**: Test separation (unit vs integration)
- **Planned**: Code structure analysis and refactoring
- **Planned**: Security and performance audit
- **Planned**: Alternative component implementations

## Task Details
This session focuses on:
1. **Code Quality**: Structured logs, separated integration tests, monkey-patch investigation, main file refactoring, code smell audit, security vulnerability review
2. **Performance**: Bottleneck identification, measurement, optimization (up to 3 attempts per issue)
3. **Architecture**: Design pluggable system for component switching
4. **Alternatives**: Basic implementations of move validator, board state, and AI algorithm as CLI options

## Recent Session Accomplishments
- ✅ **Updated project documentation**: Added current quality enhancement tasks to project_status.md and current_state.md
- ✅ **Created todo list**: Comprehensive task tracking for one-shot session
- ✅ **Previous session**: Fixed auto-evaluation for undo/redo, updated CLAUDE.md, simplified UI

## Known Issues to Investigate
- **Monkey-patch for quit bug**: Need to assess if current solution is adequate or needs cleanup
- **Main.py size**: Evaluate if file should be split for better maintainability

## Test Status
- ✅ All 142 tests passing
- ✅ Learning features fully tested
- ✅ GUI and console interfaces working
- **Next**: Separate integration tests from unit tests for better organization
