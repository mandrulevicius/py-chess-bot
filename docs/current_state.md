# PyChessBot - Current State

## Currently Working On
- Nothing active - project in maintenance mode
- All core features and learning system implemented

## Known Issues

### 1. Auto-Evaluation Update Issue (High Priority)
- **Problem**: Auto-evaluation only updates when manually requested, not after each move
- **Expected**: When auto-eval toggle is enabled, evaluation should update automatically after every move
- **Location**: `src/ui/learning_gui.py` and `src/ui/pygame_interface.py`
- **Impact**: Core learning feature not working as designed

## Recent Session Accomplishments
- Advanced learning platform fully implemented
- 142+ tests passing with comprehensive coverage
- Professional GUI with learning features
- Real-time Stockfish integration for position analysis
- Complete undo/redo system with move history
- Solo mode for chess study

## Immediate Next Steps
1. Fix auto-evaluation to trigger after each move when enabled
2. Verify all learning features work together seamlessly
3. Performance testing for evaluation updates

## Test Status
- ✅ All 142 tests passing
- ✅ Learning features fully tested
- ✅ GUI and console interfaces working
