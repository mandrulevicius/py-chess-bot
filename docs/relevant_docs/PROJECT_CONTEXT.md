# PyChessBot - Project Context

> **Essential background for understanding project goals and current state**

## üéØ **Project Purpose & Goals**

### **Original Requirements** (from initialDoc.md)
Chess game in Python, playable by humans vs AI, for **learning purposes**.

**Core prototype needs:**
- Notation-based move tracking
- Move restrictions for both humans and AIs  
- Decoupled UI for humans
- Chess AI - free, simple to implement, but not completely stupid

### **Current Status** ‚úÖ **GREATLY EXCEEDED**
PyChessBot has evolved into a **comprehensive chess learning platform** that rivals commercial chess software:

- ‚úÖ **Advanced GUI** with professional graphics and intuitive interface
- ‚úÖ **Real-time position evaluation** using Stockfish analysis  
- ‚úÖ **Learning features** - move history, undo/redo, solo mode
- ‚úÖ **Sound system** with 9 chess-specific audio effects
- ‚úÖ **Multiple interfaces** - GUI, console, keyboard shortcuts
- ‚úÖ **Production quality** - 142+ tests, robust error handling

## üèõÔ∏è **Architecture Decisions Made**

### **Technology Choices**
- **Notation**: Standard Algebraic Notation (SAN) - e4, Nf3, O-O
- **Rule Engine**: `python-chess` library for comprehensive validation
- **AI Engine**: Stockfish with Python wrapper (configurable difficulty 0-20)
- **UI Strategy**: Dual interface - Professional PyGame GUI + Educational console
- **Development**: Test Driven Development (TDD) with comprehensive coverage

### **Design Philosophy**
- **Educational focus** - prioritize learning over competitive strength
- **Simplicity** - prefer procedural over class-based when appropriate
- **Modularity** - clean separation between UI, game logic, and AI
- **Extensibility** - pluggable architecture for easy enhancement

### **Professional Quality**
- **142+ comprehensive tests** - TDD methodology ensures reliability
- **Production ready** - Robust error handling and resource management
- **Cross-platform** - Works on Windows, macOS, Linux
- **Educational focus** - Perfect for chess learning and improvement

## üîÑ **Development Methodology**

### **Test Driven Development (TDD)**
**Core development cycle:**
1. **Red**: Write a failing test for the feature
2. **Green**: Write minimal code to make the test pass  
3. **Refactor**: Clean up code while keeping tests green

### **Key Principles**
- **Make the change easy, then make the easy change**
- **Tests first** - comprehensive test coverage before implementation
- **Incremental development** - small, testable changes
- **Clean architecture** - maintain separation of concerns

### **Documentation Standards**
Per CLAUDE.md requirements:
- **Update `docs/project_status.md`** after each feature completion
- **Update `docs/current_state.md`** during development sessions
- **Maintain test coverage** and architectural integrity

## üî• **Current Development Phase**

### **Recent Focus** (High activity areas)
- **GUI Development** - `pygame_interface.py` (15 commits, 1.0 activity)
- **Learning Features** - `learning_gui.py` (6 commits, 0.9 activity)  
- **Core Orchestration** - `main.py` (8 commits, 0.9 activity)
- **AI Integration** - `stockfish_ai.py` (6 commits, 0.8 activity)

### **Stable Components**
- **Chess logic** - Core game rules and validation (stable)
- **Console interface** - Text-based interaction (mature)
- **Sound system** - Audio feedback (complete implementation)
- **Testing framework** - Comprehensive test suite (142+ tests)

## üéØ **Target Audience & Use Cases**

### **Primary Users**
- **Chess learners** - Students wanting to improve their game
- **Chess teachers** - Instructors needing analysis tools
- **Developers** - Example of clean Python architecture and TDD

### **Key Use Cases**
- **Interactive learning** - Play against AI with real-time analysis
- **Position study** - Solo mode for analyzing specific positions
- **Move analysis** - Understanding why moves are good or bad
- **Educational demonstration** - Teaching chess concepts with visual feedback

## üõ†Ô∏è **External Dependencies**

### **Required Dependencies**
- **`python-chess`** (1.999) - Core chess logic and validation
- **`pytest`** - Testing framework for TDD methodology

### **Optional Dependencies** (Graceful degradation)
- **`stockfish`** (3.28.0) - AI engine (falls back to random AI if unavailable)
- **`pygame`** (2.6.1) - GUI and sound (console mode available as fallback)
- **`numpy`** - Used for sound generation utilities

## üöÄ **Future Enhancement Opportunities**

### **Planned Improvements**
