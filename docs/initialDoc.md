chess game in python, playable by humans vs AI, for the purpose of learning the game.

for the prototype, need:
- notation-based move tracking
- move restrictions for both humans and AIs
- decoupled UI for humans.
- chess AI - free, simple to implement, but not completely stupid.
- (anything else critical that I have missed)

for each of these, list out a few options, with your recommendation and reasoning.
